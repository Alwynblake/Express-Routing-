# Class 08

## Express Routing and Param middleware

- previous labs used one file to contain all of our server functionality
- small modularization with the routes, but now we want to define all of our routing in a separate file.

# New MiddleWare
- Cors:
    lets us grab resources that are hosted at in different origin. 
- Morgan:
    log all requests in your system with morgan (similar to logger function)
